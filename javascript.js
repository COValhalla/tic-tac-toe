// Tic tac toe, 3x3 board with two options for the player, X or O
// Three of any type in a row wins

// Gameboard object will store the details of the actual game
// Gameboard grid will be stored as an array inside of a gameboard object
const gameboard = (() => {
    let gameArray = Array(8);

}

// Create CSS Grid with 3x3 layout, each grid position corresponds to gameboard grid.
// Use event listener on the grid to select target square, if square already filled remove event listener




//gameBoard/displayController will be modules, since only one is needed

//Players will be created using factories (multiples needed)
